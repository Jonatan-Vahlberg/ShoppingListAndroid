# ShoppingListAndroid

This is a examination project using Realm database to save.

The task was to create a working shopping list app. This implements many things most primaryly a Realm local Database with two tables one for shopping lists and one for shopping items 

This is the features this app provides:

* Easy userfriendly Listmaking
* Database persistence in Realm using simple and energy conservant methods.
* RecylerView with custom objects
* Swipeable and intractable cells
* Alarm Manager which postpones a scheduled intent which can later trigger even if app is closed
* Removal of unmaintained objects in database
* Clean Simple UI
* Easy to understand operations
* Localized for English, Swedish


 This is things which could improve the app

 * Location based notification
 * Image or other media attached notes
 * More Languages
 * Settings for notifications
 * And more

 I learnt through this project

 * Database in realm and JSON for android
 * Recyler views and Adapters
 * Callbacks and Intents
 * Alarm Manager and Scheduled Intent
